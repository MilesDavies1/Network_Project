Step 1:  
    Download the all the required modules   
        pip install scapy
        pip install pandas (for dataframe)
        pip install openpyxl (for excel)
        pip install tqdm 
        pip install futures

Step 2:  
    run the code
        *if no errors, the output should be a list of target ip's and traceroute results

step 3: 
    comment out line 75 (test range), and un-comment line 70 (actual ip range)
    comment out line 60 (test iterations), and uncomment line 58 (actual iterations)

step 4: 
    enter your location_num on line 65 for each location you visit on campus (4 total) and run the code
        *each person has a specified set of numbers to use (line 64)
        *this should take a while

step 5: 
    the results should be copied to an excel file named "traceroute_results.xlsx"

step 6: 
    comment out line 58 and uncomment line 59

step 7: 
    change "target_ips" on line 79 to "target_ips2"

step 8: 
    change the file name on line 85 to "traceroute_results2_{location_num}.xlsx"

step 9: 
    repeat step 4 (searching the external ip's now)

step 10: 
    the results should be copied to an excel file named "traceroute_results_2{location_num}.xlsx"

step 11:
    upload both excel files to the GitHub
