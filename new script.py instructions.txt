Step 1:  
    Download the all the required modules   
        pip install pandas (for dataframe)
        pip install openpyxl (for excel)

Step 2:  
    run the code
        *if no errors, the output should be a list of target ip's and traceroute results

step 3: 
    comment out line 75 (test range), and un-comment line 70 (actual ip range)
    comment out line 60 (test iterations), and uncomment line 58 (actual iterations)

step 4: 
    enter your person_id on line 64 and run the code
        *this should take a while

step 5: 
    the results should be copied to an excel file named "traceroute_results.xlsx"

step 6: 
    comment out line 58 and uncomment line 59

step 7: 
    change "target_ips" on line 78 to "target_ips2"

step 8: 
    change the file name on line 84 to "traceroute_results_2.xlsx"

step 9: 
    run the code

step 10: 
    the results should be copied to an excel file named "traceroute_results_2.xlsx"

step 11:
    upload both excel files to the GitHub
